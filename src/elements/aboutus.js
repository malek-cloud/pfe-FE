          Be Maker is a Digital makers space to learn new technologies and
          enhance innovation. We believe that the future of learning is evolving
          and alternative learning avenues will be significant in customizing
          peopleâ€™s learning journeys. We bring interdisciplinary interventions
          across Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) to a
          culture of Innovation, exploration, and lifelong learning. We empower
          people by providing them the confidence, tools, knowledge, space, and
          communities they need to change the world and become
          globally-conscious problem-solvers.
